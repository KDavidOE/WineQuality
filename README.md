# WineQuality
This project aims to qualify certain white wines based on their property like acidity, sugar content etc.
The project is based on a neural network implemented with CNTK library.

There are two approaches to the prolbem:
  -  Binary classification can be used to evaluate if the subject wine's quality is good or bad
  -  Multi-class classification aims to provide numerical representation for the quality of wines
